# 📚 Text Analysis for Readability and Complexity Evaluation

## 📝 Overview
This project strongly focuses on analyzing **large corpus of text** — such as **articles**, **paragraphs**, and **content collections** — to evaluate their **readability**, **complexity**, and **difficulty**.  
It automates the **extraction**, **cleaning**, **analysis**, and **export** of important linguistic features, ultimately helping to **optimize the quality of writing** for a broader audience.

> 🎯 Designed for **writers**, **editors**, **SEO specialists**, **content strategists**, and **linguistic researchers** who aim to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of their written communication.
